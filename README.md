# Credit-Data-Analysis
Aim of the project is to identify the influencing attributes using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments in future. Then it may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (too risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc., This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

We need to identify the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e., the variables which are strong indicators of default. 

We needed to find out different patterns and provide the outcomes that can help the bank in losing money while lending to their customers. 

Following attributes turned out to be prominent - GENDER, EDUCATION TYPE, FAMILY STATUS, INCOME CATEGORY, AGE GROUP, CREDIT CATEGORY, Age in Days
